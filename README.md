- The most challenging code for me was getting AWS set up and implemented into the project. After watching the AWS Cat Collector version, I realized that the coding format for our project was set up differently compared to the video. In the video, users were able to insert an image after creating an object whereas our plan was to create the object and post the image simultaneously. This led to a bunch of troubleshooting, like from figuring out the correct paths, to merging the post view function with AWS function, to the images not loading upon clicking on post. Basically it was alot of referencing the Cat Collector video to thinking outside of the box and applying the concept to our project.

## Key Takeaways 
- Communication is key in order to reach the finish line
- Everyone has strengths in different areas, so you should take advantage of other people's strengths and ask for help
- Exchanging phone numbers helps ALOT in terms of getting together to work on the project (also helps to wake them up because we would rotate on who naps)
- Even though this was an extremely long project, we did enjoy all of the late nights spent working/bonding together :)
